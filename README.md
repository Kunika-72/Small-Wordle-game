# FULL STACK DEVOLOPMENT WITH PYTHON - TECHWAVE

Hi, I made this project during the full stack devolopment with python training program conducted by <b>TechWave</b>

<br>

## Project Title:
Mini wordle 

## Tech Stack used:
Python

## About the project:
It contains a few words from which a random word is selected. You have to guess a five letter word in 6 tries. Hints will be provided for the correct, partial correct and wrong letters.

## How does the game goes on:
The random module generates a random word from the list of words. We compare each letter of the word with the letters of the word entered by the user and tells the user about the letters- whether they are correct, partial correct or wrong.
